# Desmos Lowpoly
This is a script to generate lowpoly of a image in a desmos graph. Python version uses selenium to open the browser and display the content but it's optional and you can also paste the js directly into browser console. There's also a [Javascript version](https://desmoslowpoly.netlify.app/) you can run directly in your browser.

## How to Run the Python Script

- **Clone the repo**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kapilpokhrel/Lowpoly.git
    cd Lowpoly
    git checkout origin/desmos
    ```
- **Install dependencies**
    - [**Optional**] Download browser driver for selenium.
    [Install browser drivers.](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/)
    
        You can pass -nb flag to not open the browser and get the js expressions to run on browser yourself.

    - Install python packages
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- **Run the Script**
    ```
    python lowpoly.py dogimage.jpg
    ```
    If you wish to not use selenium to open browser, you can copy the code into the desmos calculator console.
    
    - Run
        ``` 
        python lowpoly.py dogimage.jpg -nb | xclip -selection clipboard 
        ```
    - Goto https://www.desmos.com/calculator
    - Open Inspect element (Press F12) and goto console tab.
    - Paste the code and hit enter.

    Sometimes when using more points you might want to wait sometimes after browser window opens before it starts drawing.

## ~~Why Python with selenium instead of just using Javascript?~~

~~I know its tedious to clone the repo and install all dependencies just to see it open in a browser. But here are some reasons I chose python:~~
- ~~I like the fact of being able to open the graph in actual desmos app that lets you save in your account and share instead of just seeing a graph.~~
- ~~I did write it in Javascript to check but calculating entropy of a image was way too slow and I couldn't find any faster way to do it in JS.~~
- ~~It's easy with everything already done for you by python packages.:grin:~~

While all this is still true, there's now a web version but only sobel filter method is implemented.
